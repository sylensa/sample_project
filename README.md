## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

Future scope
1. I would add Capsule details page, where users can tap on a capusle to view the details
2. I would add Cores details page, where users can tap on a cores to view the details
3. Users should be able to delete a capsule or a cores
4. Users should be able to reorder the capsule or the cores.
